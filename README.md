# 🧑‍🎓 Research Project – Cybersecurity for Children (SafeStart Learning)

This repository contains my **research project** on cybersecurity in early childhood education, developed as a professional discussion paper for *SafeStart Learning*.  
The work investigates cyber risks faced by children in digital learning environments and proposes both **technical safeguards** and **governance frameworks** to protect student welfare while ensuring regulatory compliance.
